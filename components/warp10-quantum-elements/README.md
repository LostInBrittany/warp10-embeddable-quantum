# Warp 10 Quantum Elements

[Warp 10's Quantum](https://github.com/cityzendata/warp10-quantum) is a web application developed to easily deal with the [Warp 10](http://www.warp10.io) platform.

Entirely developed as [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) elements, we have splitted in in two repositories:
the [main one](https://github.com/cityzendata/warp10-quantum) with all the high level applicative logic and [this one](https://github.com/cityzendata/warp10-quantum-elements) with the individual elements.  The logic behind this split is to be able to re-use more easily the components defined here in order to embed them in other applications.
